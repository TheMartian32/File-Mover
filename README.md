# File-Mover

This script has the ability to create folders to move files into. It can also move files into a folder that has already been created.
Also, just in case, mainly due to unpredicable code ( Note: This code has been tested so far and it hasn't lost any of my personal data )
make a backup of your data. 
Lastly, run this script in the directory you have the files you want to move in. ( e.g ```pwd = /Users/user/FolderYouHaveTheFilesIn ; python files.py``` )
